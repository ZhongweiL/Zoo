    <h2>Tiger</h2>
    <p>
        tiger, (Panthera tigris), largest member of the cat family (Felidae), rivaled only by the lion 
        (Panthera leo) in strength and ferocity. The tiger is endangered throughout its range, which 
        stretches from the Russian Far East through parts of North Korea, China, India, and Southeast 
        Asia to the Indonesian island of Sumatra. The Siberian, or Amur, tiger (P. tigris altaica) is the 
        largest, measuring up to 4 metres (13 feet) in total length and weighing up to 300 kg (660 pounds)
        . The Indian, or Bengal, tiger (P. tigris tigris) is the most numerous and accounts for about 
        half of the total tiger population. Males are larger than females and may attain a shoulder 
        height of about 1 metre and a length of about 2.2 metres, excluding a tail of about 1 metre; 
        weight is 160–230 kg (350–500 pounds), and tigers from the south are smaller than those of the 
        north.
