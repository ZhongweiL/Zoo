    <h2>Elephant</h2>
    <p>
        Elephant, (family Elephantidae), largest living land animal, characterized by 
        its long trunk (elongated upper lip and nose), columnar legs, and huge head 
        with temporal glands and wide, flat ears. Elephants are grayish to brown in 
        colour, and their body hair is sparse and coarse. They are found most often in 
        savannas, grasslands, and forests but occupy a wide range of habitats, 
        including deserts, swamps, and highlands in tropical and subtropical regions of 
        Africa and Asia.
