    <h2>Zebra</h2>
    <p>
        Zebras are equids, members of the horse family. They have excellent hearing and 
        eyesight and can run at speeds of up to 35 miles per hour (56 kilometers per 
        hour). They also have a powerful kick that can cause serious injury to a 
        predator, like a lion, a hyena, or an African wild dog. Usually the lead male 
        of the herd, called a stallion, sounds the alarm if danger is spotted and stays 
        at the back of the group to defend against predators if necessary, while the 
        mares (females) and foals (youngsters) run away.
